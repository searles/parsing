# Invertible Parser Combinators

This project is implemented in Java and Kotlin. It provides parser combinators
that are invertible, ie, a parser using this project is also a pretty printer.

## In a nutshell

* Define recursive descent parsers using parser combinators, and you will get
    + A parser
    + A fast recognizer that verifies the syntax without creating a syntax tree (very useful for eg code style checkers)
    + A pretty printer
* Multiple lexers per parsers
    + Very fast lexer using one single FSA per lexer
* [work in progress] Utilities to generate java-class parsers from a text file with ANTLR-alike syntax

## Introduction

These Java classes provide parser combinators. A parser combinator is a function that combines
parsers in various ways (choice, sequence, repetition, ...) and they are widely used for instance
in Scala.

Writing a parser using parser combinators is very easy because the combinators correspond to
the operations that are available in a grammar. Yet a grammar definition for a parser can do
more - it is also a blue print for a pretty printer, a program that prints a text based on a grammar
definition.

This project therefore aims to do both: Define a grammar using parser generators and obtain a
pretty printer for free.

## Motivating Example

The motivating example is written in Kotlin although the parser combinators are written in Java8.

Writing a pretty printer can be difficult, if there are precedence rules. Consider the following
grammar (following the POSIX standard):

~~~
sum: product ('+' product)*
product: term ('*' term)*
term: num | '(' sum ')'
num: [0-9]+
~~~

The expressions `1 + 2 * 3` or `(1 + 2) * 3` are accepted by this grammar
with different syntax trees: 

~~~
 1 + 2 * 3 | (1 + 2) * 3
-----------+-------------
   +       |     *
  / \      |    / \
 1   *     |   +   3
    / \    |  / \
   2   3   | 1   2
~~~

In a pretty printer, it requires a complex case distinction to determine in what cases parentheses are needed.
Since this information is encoded in the grammar though, inverting the parser
fully takes care of this task.
